Data analysis done on Netflix data. This was done as part of the intermediate python course in data camp. The project looks to transform data in python using pandas then visualise the insight using matplotlib. The project looks at trends in movie data across netflix's large library of content as well as looking into guest appearances on the NBC show 'The Office.'
